# Enhanced Hinge‑Bracket Design <!-- project title -->

## 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;Task Concept
The assignment is to *re‑engineer a small hinge‑style bracket—originally defined by fixed outer dimensions (Ø 45 mm base, 54 mm span, 29 mm height, 4.5 mm thickness)—so that it can **withstand higher loads while preserving its envelope*.  
Each participant creates a new 3‑D model, runs a finite‑element analysis (FEA) to verify the improvement, and submits the design for a group comparison against the baseline part.

## 2&nbsp;–&nbsp;Why This Task Matters
* *Mechanical reliability* – Real‑world joints and pivots often fail at stress concentrations. Optimising geometry early reduces warranty claims, downtime, and material waste.  
* *Design‑for‑simulation workflow* – Combining CAD with FEA familiarises engineers with an industry‑standard loop: model → analyse → iterate → validate.  
* *Light‑weighting & sustainability* – A stiffer bracket that uses no extra material (or even less) saves cost and lowers the carbon footprint of mass‑produced assemblies.  
* *Portfolio value* – Documenting each iteration in GitHub demonstrates version control, parametric design skills, and data‑driven decision‑making to future employers.

## 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;Typical Use Cases
| Sector | Example Application | Benefit of an Optimised Bracket |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Robotics & Automation | Servo‑mounted wrist joints | Smoother motion, higher payload capacity |
| Mobility Devices | Wheelchair folding mechanisms | Increased safety factor without added weight |
| Aerospace Interiors | Seat recline linkages | Meets certification loads with lighter alloys |
| Industrial Machinery | Sensor mounting arms | Minimises vibration and calibration drift |

## 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;Recommended CAD / CAE Tools
| Tool | Key Strengths for This Task | Licence Model |
|------|----------------------------|---------------|
| *Autodesk Inventor* | Native parametric modelling, built‑in Stress Analysis, iLogic for quick design variants | Education & commercial |
| *SolidWorks* | Powerful Simulation add‑ins, Design Study optimisation, extensive material library | Commercial; student editions available |
| *Onshape* | Cloud‑based collaboration, version control baked in, integrated SimScale connector for FEA | Free for public projects & paid tiers |

> *Tip:* Use identical material properties and boundary conditions across tools to ensure apples‑to‑apples FEA results.

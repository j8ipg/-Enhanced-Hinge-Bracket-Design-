![task  req](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8899e0a8-42e7-439b-a494-bbdb00f3e2d2)
- Improve the joint design so that it has better durability - taking into account some of the dimensions previously attached.



- Design after implementation:

## 1&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;Task Concept
The assignment is to *reâ€‘engineer a small hingeâ€‘style bracketâ€”originally defined by fixed outer dimensions (Ã˜â€¯45â€¯mm base, 54â€¯mm span, 29â€¯mm height, 4.5â€¯mm thickness)â€”so that it can **withstand higher loads while preserving its envelope*.  
Each participant creates a new 3â€‘D model, runs a finiteâ€‘element analysis (FEA) to verify the improvement, and submits the design for a group comparison against the baseline part.

## 2&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;Why This Task Matters
* *Mechanical reliability* â€“â€¯Realâ€‘world joints and pivots often fail at stress concentrations. Optimising geometry early reduces warranty claims, downtime, and material waste.  
* *Designâ€‘forâ€‘simulation workflow* â€“â€¯Combining CAD with FEA familiarises engineers with an industryâ€‘standard loop: model â†’ analyse â†’ iterate â†’ validate.  
* *Lightâ€‘weighting & sustainability* â€“â€¯A stiffer bracket that uses no extra material (or even less) saves cost and lowers the carbon footprint of massâ€‘produced assemblies.  
* *Portfolio value* â€“â€¯Documenting each iteration in GitHub demonstrates version control, parametric design skills, and dataâ€‘driven decisionâ€‘making to future employers.

## 3&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;Typical Use Cases
| Sector | Example Application | Benefit of an Optimised Bracket |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Robotics & Automation | Servoâ€‘mounted wrist joints | Smoother motion, higher payload capacity |
| Mobility Devices | Wheelchair folding mechanisms | Increased safety factor without added weight |
| Aerospace Interiors | Seat recline linkages | Meets certification loads with lighter alloys |
| Industrial Machinery | Sensor mounting arms | Minimises vibration and calibration drift |

## 4&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;Recommended CAD / CAE Tools
| Tool | Key Strengths for This Task | Licence Model |
|------|----------------------------|---------------|
| *Autodeskâ€¯Inventor* | Native parametric modelling, builtâ€‘in Stress Analysis, iLogic for quick design variants | Education & commercial |
| *SolidWorks* | Powerful Simulation addâ€‘ins, Design Study optimisation, extensive material library | Commercial; student editions available |
| *Onshape* | Cloudâ€‘based collaboration, version control baked in, integrated SimScale connector for FEA | Free for public projects & paid tiers |
